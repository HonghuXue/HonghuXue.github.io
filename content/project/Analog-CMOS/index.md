We worked as a two-person team from 04.2015 to 07.2015 during my master study in University of Freiburg. The main task includes:

(i)Schematic design of a two-stage amplifier through Cadence

(ii)Tuning Circuit parameter to meet various standards e.g. Unity Gain Bandwidth, pole-zero compensation , Ac gain, Phase Margin ...

(iii)Conducting Monte-Carlo and Corner Simulation
