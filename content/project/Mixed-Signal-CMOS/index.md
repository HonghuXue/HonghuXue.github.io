We worked as a two-person team from 09.2015 to 02.2016 during my master study in University of Freiburg. The main task includes,

(i)Proceeding with the Analog CMOS circuit design project

(ii)Layout Design of a two-stage amplifier in Cadence, i.e., the layout of capacitors and other circuit components

(iii)Performing validation on main standards under different circumstances
