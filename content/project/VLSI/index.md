We worked as a four-person team from 04.2015 to 08.2015 during my master study in University of Freiburg. The task includes,

(i) Design and implementation of a simple calculator on FPGA

(ii) Realizing the functionality of (a)UKM910 processor, (b)PS2 input interface, (c)VGA output interface 

(iii) Implemented via VHDL for hardware part and assembly language for computation part
