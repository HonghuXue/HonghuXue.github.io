abstract: Even with several advances in autonomous mobile robots, navigation in a highly dynamic environment still remains a challenge. Classical navigation systems, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), build a map of the environment and constructing maps of highly dynamic environments is impractical. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches have the ability to learn policies without knowledge of the maps or the transition models of the environment. The aim of our work is to investigate the potential of using DRL to control an autonomous mobile robot to dock with a load carrier. This paper presents an initial successful training result of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which can navigate a robot toward an open door only based on the 360Â° LiDAR observations. Ongoing work is using visual sensors for load carrier docking.
